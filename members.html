            Aristotle’s intellectual range was vast, covering most of the sciences and many of the arts,
            including biology, botany, chemistry, ethics, history, logic, metaphysics, rhetoric, philosophy of mind,
            philosophy of science, physics, poetics, political theory, psychology, and zoology. He was the founder of formal logic,
            devising for it a finished system that for centuries was regarded as the sum of the discipline;
            and he pioneered the study of zoology, both observational and theoretical, in which some of his work remained
            unsurpassed until the 19th century. But he is, of course, most outstanding as a philosopher. His writings in ethics and
            political theory as well as in metaphysics and the philosophy of science continue to be studied, and his work remains a 
            powerful current in contemporary philosophical debate.

                        Socrates was a widely recognized and controversial figure in his native Athens, so much so that he was frequently
                        mocked in the plays of comic dramatists. (The Clouds of Aristophanes, produced in 423, is the best-known example.)
                        Although Socrates himself wrote nothing, he is depicted in conversation in compositions by a small circle of his
                        admirers—Plato and Xenophon first among them. He is portrayed in these works as a man of great insight, integrity,
                        self-mastery, and argumentative skill. The impact of his life was all the greater because of the way in which it ended:
                        at age 70, he was brought to trial on a charge of impiety and sentenced to death by poisoning (the poison probably
                        being hemlock) by a jury of his fellow citizens. Plato’s Apology of Socrates purports to be the speech Socrates gave
                        at his trial in response to the accusations made against him (Greek apologia means “defense”). Its powerful advocacy
                        of the examined life and its condemnation of Athenian democracy have made it one of the central documents of Western
                        thought and culture.
